# hello-world
My place to experiment with the features of Git and GitHub.  
Added this line for my first commit on branch "readme-edits".  
Added this line for my first commit on the "main" branch.  
(Accepted the changes of both branches during the resolve of the conflict.)  
The user "Gere-uebt" added this line on his fork.
